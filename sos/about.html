            <h1>Who We Are: </h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify">Seeds of Solidarity consists of two entities that are fiscally distinct, but
                connected by land, spirit and vision: Seeds of Solidarity Farm, and Seeds of Solidarity Education Center
                Inc, a 501 c 3 non-profit organization with a passionate staff of 4, a sage board of directors, and
                wonderful community partnerships.

                Seeds of Solidarity was founded by Ricky Baruc and Deb Habib who met in 1984 while working at the New
                Alchemy Institute on Cape Cod MA, a small international organization whose purpose was to “design
                human-scale, low polluting alternatives to super technology and to design and test intensive food
                growing methods.” Deb and RickNew Alchemy’s impact on Ricky and Deb’s lives and that of many others was
                profound. They spent the next decade or so farming (Ricky) and working in the fields of multicultural
                and environmental education (Deb). Then in 1994/1995 took part in the International Pilgrimage for Peace
                and Life, walking from Auschwitz to Hiroshima. Seeds of Solidarity Farm and Education Center was
                initiated in 1996, in the spirit of New Alchemy and in honor of those around the world helping to feed
                the people.</p>

            <h1>What We Do: </h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify">Seeds of Solidarity Farm was initiated in 1996, on land in the middle of the
                forest that had not been cultivated for many years, and the original inhabitants of the region being the
                Wampanoag, Nipmuc, and Pequoit people. A conservation restriction on our 30 acres ensures the land will
                always be used for agriculture, education, and wildlife habitat. With nature as teacher, the land has
                been transformed into fertile fields and hosts 5 solar hoophouses brimming with our signature greens,
                fruit and perennial crops, garlic and sacred, traditional crops such as Hopi blue and Narraganset flour
                corn. The tapestry of our site includes energy efficient and off the grid home, office, and farm
                outbuildings, including Solidarity Handworks, a solar powered farmstand, and celebration art and words
                of inspiration along the paths.

                GH with Class With the growth in people wanting local food, we ask, ‘How can more people participate not
                only as consumers, but producers?’ To build local food self-reliance, we need accessible, affordable and
                yes, fun practices that mimic nature, help decentralize food production and engage more people in
                cultivating the earth in order to Grow Food Everywhere. We use cardboard on marginal land to foster
                worms, microbes and mychorrizal fungi that decompose the cardboard and build a fertile soil ecosystem.
                In addition to an increase in worm castings (poop), using cardboard as mulch helps balance moisture,
                keep weeds down, and create no-till carbon sinks that retain rather than release CO2 into the
                atmosphere. Cardboard- a waste product available in most communities– is key to growing gardens on
                lawns, lots, school yards, municipal buildings for opening up and improving plots of land.

                It is an honor to grow food in solidarity with small farmers around the world, and those everywhere
                helping to feed the people.</p>
